Here are some great resources that I used to teach myself:

- The Book
https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/

- Everything on fasterthanli.me, starting with
https://fasterthanli.me/articles/understanding-rust-futures-by-going-way-too-deep

- Rust By Example (follows the same chapter ordering to The Book)
https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/

- Rustlings code kata, learn by fixing tiny failing tests
https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings

- My video series on Rust (of course!) playlist here, watch RUST-6 first (my recommended set up) and then the rest in any order:

- My Discord server, especially #programming and #newbie-advice. There's a huge community of friendly folks here, answering questions on Rust all day every day. Do tag me and say hi!

Have fun, and good luck!
